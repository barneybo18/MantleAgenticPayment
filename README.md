# 🤖 BOGENT - Autonomous Payments on Mantle


**BOGENT** is a decentralized agentic payment platform built on the **Mantle Network**. It empowers users with AI-driven "agents" for autonomous payment handling, recurring scheduling, and seamless invoice management.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🧾 Decentralized Invoicing**: Create, track, and pay on-chain invoices with full transparency.
- **🤖 Autonomous Agents**: Configure "agents" to handle recurring payments (payroll, subscriptions) automatically.
- **💰 Funded Agents**: Agents hold funds directly (MNT or ERC20 tokens) for trustless execution.
- **⚡ Multi-Token Support**: Native **$MNT**, **USDT**, **USDC**, **mETH**, **cmETH**, **WETH** - network-aware token selection.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: Click stat cards to drill down into payments received, pending invoices, and wallet details.
- **🔄 Pause/Resume**: Full control over your agents with one-click pause and resume.
- **✏️ Edit Paused Agents**: Update or delete agents even when they are paused or terminated.
- **⏱️ Scheduled Termination**: Set end dates for agents to auto-terminate at a specific time.
- **🔮 Transaction Simulation**: Pre-flight transaction checks for better error handling and UX.
- **🕸️ Network Aware**: Automatically detects Mainnet/Testnet and uses the correct contract + tokens.
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works beautifully on all screen sizes.
- **🔔 Transaction Feedback**: Real-time toast notifications and transaction modals with Mantlescan links.

### Contract Features

The `AgentPay.sol` smart contract provides:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `createInvoice()` | Create on-chain invoices with metadata, due dates, and token type |
| `payInvoice()` | Pay invoices using native MNT or ERC20 tokens |
| `cancelInvoice()` | Cancel unpaid invoices (creator only) |
| `createScheduledPayment()` | Deploy autonomous payment agents with initial funding |
| `updateScheduledPayment()` | Update agent end dates (works on paused agents) |
| `executeScheduledPayment()` | Execute due payments (called by worker/keeper) |
| `cancelScheduledPayment()` | Terminate agent and refund remaining balance (works on paused agents) |
| `toggleAgentStatus()` | Pause or resume an agent |
| `topUpAgent()` | Add more funds to an active agent |

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barneybo18/MantleAgenticPayment.git
   cd MantleAgenticPayment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## 🤖 Running the Agent Worker

The worker script executes due payments automatically:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/worker.js --network mantleSepolia
```

## 🧪 Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts to testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mantleSepolia
```


## 🔐 Security

- **Ownable**: Contract ownership for administrative control.
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protected against reentrancy attacks.
- **Non-Custodial**: Users verify all transactions via their wallet.
- **Funded Agents**: Agents hold their own funds - no approvals needed at execution time.
- **Transaction Simulation**: Pre-flight checks prevent failed transactions and provide clear error messages.
